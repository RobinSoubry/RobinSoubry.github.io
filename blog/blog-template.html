<!-- REFLECTION
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
	It was actually fun and inspiring to co-work on a mock-up.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
	Yes definitely. The wireframe helped to thing in larger skeleton-blocks of code (navigation, article, footer etc) before detailing it down later on. I have the impression that without a mock-up, we would have had the tendency to dive into the code straight away and get lost in desorganisation.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
	As the goal is to create  template for future blogposts, we defined a generalitic structure that can be reused over and over again, and is yet specific enough to provide details on a wide variety of subjects. For example next to th main article, we will provide an image that can further explain a specific concept.
	The blogpost itself is also embedded in the larger site as a whole.
	We could have made some improvements by providing additional context for the reader through breadcrumbs etc.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
	We applied following semantic HTML tags:
		<nav>: Indication of main navigation links on the site
		<header>: In the header we wrapped the main title of the blogpost as well as a brief summary.
		<footer>: The footer holds various links that users often look for, without giving these too much presence on the overall site (ie. links to our social profiles)
		<figure>: A tag to highlight additional clarification of a concept through a visual image. (Not precisely the same a just a photo) 
		<figcaption>: A caption that goes together with the figure.
